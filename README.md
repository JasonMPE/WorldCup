### Tools:

1. CSS preprocessor---Less
2. Canvas 

### Delaration:

1. Though did some compatible work， IE6，7, 8 are not recommended. They dont support Canvas.
2. One more serious problem is that this does not work on Chrome, IE, Opera in local test in windwos. You can do it on Firefox. Probably better on Safari if you are a Mac OS user.
